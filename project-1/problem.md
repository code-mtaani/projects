# BBI Signature Verification Data.

In January 2021, the IEBC released an interim list of verified signatures for the BBI initiative as referenced in this\
letter [https://www.iebc.or.ke/uploads/resources/JkcR5xZbit.pdf](https://www.iebc.or.ke/uploads/resources/JkcR5xZbit.pdf) from the data released,\
the format is in the form of pdf which is a format that cannot be easily queried. \
The aim of this task is to create a simple web application that will enable users to search whether their details are in the data published by IEBC.

How we shall accomplish this is by first converting the data from pdf to csv and then import it into a suitable database. \
From the database, the data is to be accessed through an API and finally be queried by users from a simple front end.

## Required tools:
  - Git/Github
  - Any database
  - API based on any language
  - Javascript / any frontend framework
## Optional tools:
  - Docker
  - Trello
